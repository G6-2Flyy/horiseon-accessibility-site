# Horiseon Accessibility Site

## Description

This project is to improve the accessibility and functionality for end users, increasing the overall experience. It does so by incorporating code enhancements that not only enhances search engine optimization, but also makes navigation easier for the company's target audience, including those with impairments. 

- I was motivated by the business and community impact of this project.
- Poor SEO and dips in market utilization are correlated.
- I refactored code to improve how the site look and what it does at the user level
- Optimization drives reputation, which drives user experience.
